#summary how to move the content and images from one wiki to the other

= move images =
1. dump all images from wiki record
{{{
cd ONEWIKI
php maintenance/dumpUploads.php > list.txt
}}}

2. run a small bash script to copy all images to a temporary directory t.
{{{
vi copy.sh
chmod +x copy.sh
mkdir t
./copy.sh
}}}
the content of copy.sh is listed below
{{{
#!/bin/bash
# read a file line by line
while read line
do
 cp $line t
done < list.txt
}}}

3. import the images to another wiki, where 't' is the directory containing images
{{{
cd OTHERWIKI
php maintenance/importImages.php t
}}}
note: images in t's subdirectory will not be imported. unlike directly copying files, wike upload records (in database) will be created.
